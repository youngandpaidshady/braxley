# Preview Your Built Website

## 🌐 Local Preview Server

A local server has been started to preview your built website.

### Access Your Site

**Open your browser and visit:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

The server is running from the `deploy_build/` directory, which contains your production-ready static files.

### What You'll See

- ✅ Homepage with all sections
- ✅ Projects listing page
- ✅ Individual project detail pages
- ✅ Contact page
- ✅ Blog page
- ✅ All images and assets
- ✅ Optimized and minified code

### Stop the Server

To stop the preview server:
1. Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
2. Or close the terminal window

### Alternative: Open Files Directly

You can also open the files directly:
1. Navigate to `deploy_build/index.html`
2. Right-click → "Open with" → Your browser
3. Note: Some features may not work correctly when opening files directly (use the server for best results)
